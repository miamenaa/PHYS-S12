### Week 5: 3D Design & Printing

<br>

<p>This week we learned about 3D Design and how to use the 3D Printer. My assignment was to print a component of my final project and use a 3D scanner (I used a RevoScan). I printing a snap-fit box and scanned a rubber duck.</p>

<br>

#####<strong>3D Printed Snap-Fit Box</strong>

<p> Going into this assignment I knew I wanted to work on my final project, so I decided to 3D print a prototype for the glasses cleaning machine. For this case, I split the design into two: a top for the glasses and a bottom for the motor and more. I modeled the case on Fusion 360 (<a href="https://miamenaa.github.io/PHYS-S12/finalproject.html">Final Project Page</a>)and pushed it to PrusaSlicer; however, the case was going to take 15 hours to print. Instead, I decided to print a snap-fit box.</p> 

<p>I thought that a snap fit box was the best way for me to go about this assignment since it allows me to better understand how/what my case would look like and what I should fix for the actual case prototype. For example, I wanted to print the case because I wanted to see if the box would be watertight, however, the snap fix box would also show me the conditions of 3D printing with water. Furthermore, because I split my case design into two, I needed a way to be able to both connect and disconnect the different bodies. After some research on joining 3D printed parts together I came to the conclusion that I should try a snap-fit box.</p>

<strong>The Design</strong>

<p>The designing of the box was actually much better than expected. I defineitly think I am getting the hang of Fusion360. Nonetheless, when establishing the snap-fit aspect I definitely relied on a <a href="https://youtu.be/YCUkFGI3RZI" target="_blank">youtube video</a>. 

<p>I made the bottom part of the box 50mm by 50mm and shelled the inside, with a thickness of 5mm, to make it hollow. At the top, I created a square of 3mm by 9mm, estruded it as a cut by 3mm and with a taper angle of -45 degrees. I also used the fillet feature on the middle line by .4mm. This body was mirrored on opposite sides.</p>

<p>I made the top part 60mm by 60mm and shelled the bottom part, also with a thickness of 5mm, to make it hollow. In the inside, I created the same type of square with the only difference being the extrude was a join feature. Furthermore, I used the chamfer feature on the middle line by .6mm. This body was mirroed on opposite sides.</p>

<strong>The Printing Process</strong>

<p>I moved to to PrusaSlicer and printed it. Overall, the entire print took 3 hours and 26 minutes.</p>

<strong>Features</strong>

<p>The main reason I did this specific print was because of the snap fit and trying to see if it is water tight. The snap fit, while it did work was very hard to get on and off. I think that I could fillet or chamfer the snaps fit more effectively.</p> 

<p>Furthermore, the box was mostly water tight. The 3D Print itself was completely water tight, unless held on its side, where water would slowly leak. However, when held straight up and even upside down, no water leaked through.</p>

#####<strong>3D Scanner</strong>

<p>For the 3D Scanning aspect of the assignment I scanned a rubber duck. I tried using a photogrammetry application (PolyCam), however, I encountered too many problems when trying to get a genuinely good scan. Instead, I decided to scan in the lab on RevoScan.</p>
