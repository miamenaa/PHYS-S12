### Week 3: Electronics and Tools

<p>This week we learned about Electronics and Tools, specifically power/motors, soldering, saws, and drills. My assignment was make a kinetic sculpture. Because of the heat we have been experincing in this past few days, I thought out making a turbine/fan.</p>

 ##### <strong>Kinetic Sculpture: Turbine/Fan</strong> 

 <p>The first step of this process was really to design and model what the Turbine would look like. I first did this on my iPad and later on Fuison 360. I designed the pieces separately, the base/tower and the then the blades. Using the joint function I was able to add the two components together and really see what the turbine would look like.
