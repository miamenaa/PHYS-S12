### Week 8: CNC Milling & Mold/Cast

<br>

<p>This week we learned about CNC Milling, alongside molding and casting. I decided to use the CNC milling machine, or the SRM-20, over the ShopBot, and use that mill as my mold to make another mold. Eventually, I molded a very tiny coke bottle. </p>

<br>

##### <strong>CNC Milling</strong>

<p>The first part of the assignment was to use a CNC milling machine. The options avaliable in the lab was the SRM-20 (also referred to as the orange machine), the ShopBot, and the Shaper. I decided to use the SRM-20 because this would automatically allow me to transiiton to the second part of the assignment. The depth of the mill was 7 inches and was 25 in by 35 inch. The STL Model is below.</p>

<br>

<p>Overall the milling experince was intereting. Because of certain shapes of the Coca-Cola bottle, the mold was going to be milled as a 3D Print. We used the 1/16 inch spindle, and after uploading data into the computer, the machine began to work. The mold was only milled once, however, not much detail was needed. Overall, the milling process took about 5-10 minutes.</p>

<br>

##### <strong>Molding</strong>

<br>

<p>From here I decided to mold this mill. First I needed to make a mold of the wax that was milled, and then I needed to use that mold to make the singular coke mold.</p>

<br>

<p>I used the Clear OOMOO Molding Set for the first step. The process was simple by just adding equal components of A and B together, mixing them, and simply pouring such into the mold.</p>

<p>Then the actual Coke bottle itse;lf was molded. This was done by using the purple OOMOO set and following the same instructions as the clear bottles. I let the mold form and the next day my coke bottle was made.</p>
